# Holdex Contributing Guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [holdex.io](https://holdex.io) or related websites. Please read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

## Getting started

There are 3 core concepts which are the core pilars of our collaboration success:
1. **Goal** – a business aim
1. **Problem** – an issue that is on the way to help us achieve the goal
1. **Solution** – a mean of solving a problem

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow: from finding a goal to work on, identifying the obstacles (problems) to achieve it, and the process of delivering your solutions.

### Goal

As soon as you get involved in one of our projects, you must understand the it's current goal.  
Investigate the conversations, make your own assessments, and figure out how things are already moving towards achieving the goal. 
It is crucial to understand the business context of the goal and how achieving the goal will impact the project.

All goals can be identified as GitHub issues in the relevant repository. Goals are created and managed by Partner level contributor.

### Problem
Once the goal is clear, you must identify what stops you from achieving it. Anything that is stopping us - is a “Problem”. A typical question to ask are: "what valuable action the user can’t perform?".

As team members, we find and report these problems through [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues). Sometimes, a Goal already has a few problems reported, but it’s not always the case. 

We’re counting on our contributors to find these problems.

### Solve the Problem
The third final pillar of our success is the "solution". Different problems may require different sets of skills. Whether it’s code, design, or marketing material, we expect a lean and clean solution you can provide in your area of expertise.

If the source-code modification is required, the solution is presented as [GitHub PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests). 

Our solution requiremest:
1. [Keep PRs small](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2021/03/09/strategies-for-small-focused-pull-requests/) and completable within 3-4 hours. If the solution requires more time, then decompose the problem into smaller problems until you can solve that problem within 3-4 hours.
2. When creating PRs and commits, make sure the name of the PR is super [clean and simple](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/#how-to-write-good-pr-titles). You must follow [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) guidelines here.
