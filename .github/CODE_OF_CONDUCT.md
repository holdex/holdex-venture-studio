Tips
Ensure the quality of your work. Don’t expect someone else to review your work if the problem is solved. It’s usually a sign of poor ownership and lack of confidence unless you’re a beginner. 
Limit and scope your work to smaller deliverables. Aim to deliver something every 3-4 hours. 
Problems can be decomposed into sub-problems.
Assign yourself to the Problem you are solving so others can see it.
Don’t use `@ mention` when you want to thank or agree with someone. Use GitHub reaction instead.
Leave updates regularly to keep things transparent for everyone.
Can’t provide a Solution within a working day? Leave a note inside the Problem issue with the latest status update.
